    <h2 class="title1">Our organiation values</h2>

    <p> We are an organisation that actively works to promote books that display diversity. We feel as though it is important that everyone can recognise themselves in litrature and learn about others cultures and experiences. Reading is an amazing way to explore the world and Book Sorter has different lists of our favourite books that are sorted into their genres. If you dont know where to start, take a look at our explore page or if you know just what you're looking for then use the dropdown menu to select your genre.  </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
      alert("Hello there book-worm! Do you know what genre of book you enjoy the most?");
  var answer = prompt("Yes [y] or No [n]");
  
  if (answer === 'y') {
    alert("Perfect! Select your favourite one from our Genres tab and see our suggestions.");
  } else {
    alert("Great! Our Explore page will show you the whole selection and you can find the one that is right for you.");
      }
      </script>
